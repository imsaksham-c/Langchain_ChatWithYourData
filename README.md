# LangChain Chat with Your Data

Welcome to the LangChain Chat with Your Data repository! Here, you'll find all the resources and materials related to our new short course, which focuses on leveraging LangChain for building practical applications that allow interaction with data using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

## Course Overview

In this course, we delve into two main topics:

1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Explore a common LLM application that retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset.
2. **Building Chatbots**: Learn how to build a chatbot that responds to queries based on the content of your documents, rather than just learned information.
